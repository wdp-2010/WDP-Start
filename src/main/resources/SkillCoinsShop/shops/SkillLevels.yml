# ║ - Early levels (1-25): Cheap, helps new players catch up                      ║
# ║ - Mid levels (26-50): Moderate, still accessible                              ║
# ║ - Late levels (51-75): Expensive, rewards dedicated players                   ║
# ║ - End levels (76-100): Very expensive, prestige purchases                     ║

# ║ This allows catching up but makes grinding still valuable                     ║
# ║ A player who grinds earns tokens from level-ups AND gets skills               ║
# ║ A player who buys levels spends tokens without earning them back              ║
